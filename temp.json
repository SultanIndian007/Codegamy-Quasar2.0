        "question": "What is object-oriented programming (OOP)? Explain its principles.",
        "best_answer": "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects,' which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures. The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction."

      {
        "tags": ["oop", "interview", "encapsulation"],
        "question": "What is encapsulation in OOP?",
        "best_answer": "Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restriction of direct access to some of an object's components. It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes the necessary functionality."

        "tags": ["oop", "interview", "inheritance"],
        "question": "Explain inheritance in OOP with an example.",
        "best_answer": "Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass or base class). For example, a 'Vehicle' class can be a superclass, and 'Car' and 'Bike' classes can inherit from it, inheriting properties like 'speed' and 'fuel type'."

      {
        "tags": ["oop", "interview", "polymorphism"],
        "question": "What is polymorphism in OOP?",
        "best_answer": "Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass."
      },
      {
        "tags": ["oop", "interview", "abstraction"],
        "question": "Explain abstraction in OOP and its significance.",
        "best_answer": "Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It simplifies the programming model and makes it easier to work with complex systems by focusing on the essential aspects."
